# Euphoria colour palette
The following colour palette was created in the context of the course STA303 at the University of Toronto. 

This palette is based on colours used in the hit show Euphoria. Two colours for each of the six characters (Rue Bennett, Lexi Howard, Maddy Perez, Cassie Howard, Kat Hernandez, and Jules Vaughn) were chosen. These were selected on the basis of lighting used in these characters' scenes and fashion styles. 

This palette can be used to create plots in R.
